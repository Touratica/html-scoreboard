A purposely created set containing HTML, CSS (preprocessed Sass) and JavaScript (transpiled TypeScript) files to be used
as a Browser Source in Streamlabs OBS, in order to add a programmable scoreboard to a Scene.

## Introduction

### Motivations

This piece of code was motivated by the need of having an electronic programmable scoreboard in Streamlabs OBS, with
quick and simple controls, in order to use said program to broadcast the Portuguese first tier division national league
matches of korfball on YouTube, starting May 1, 2021.
